## Features

#### Logo
----
The logo is the name of the game. It is designed to be fun, quirky and enticing. Encouraging game users to take part.

#### Menu Bar
----
* New Game: The user is able to click this button to clear the current game or commence a 'new game'.

* Sound: The sound plays in the background of the game - the user can toggle this on or off. 

#### Game Area
----
The game area itself is the most important part of the screen. Its content is large and sits in the centre of the screen. It has a shadow effect to to make it appear raised off the screen.

The game can be played on any device. Where a keypad is available - the arrow keys are programmed for use. On a mobile the on screen arrow button controls control the game. 

#### Footer

The footer is plain and contains a simple copyright message. 

## Design
----
* Typography: I used [Bangers](https://fonts.google.com/?query=bangers). It is a fun font for this game. It has a comic like script. 

* Colour Scheme: The colours were chosed to be edgy and fun. The Dark Green of the background allows the brighter colours to pop off the screen. They are accessible and easy to view colours.
